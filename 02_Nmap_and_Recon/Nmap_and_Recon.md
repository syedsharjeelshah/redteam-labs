#  Week 2 – Nmap & Network Scanning (Complete Beginner-Friendly Breakdown)

---

## 🎯 Objective:

> “Before hacking any system, you need to discover it, scan it, and understand what’s running on it.”

Think of this as **information gathering**.
It’s how hackers find weak points — like open ports, old versions of services, or misconfigurations.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Discover Live Hosts (Ping Sweep)

### 🔧 Command:

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

### 🧠 Explanation:

* `-sn`: Ping scan (no port scanning)
* This will tell you which IPs are **live** in your local network
* Use this when you don’t know what machine to attack yet

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Scan Open Ports

### 🔧 Command:

```bash
nmap -sS -p- 192.168.1.10
```

### 🧠 Explanation:

* `-sS`: Stealth (SYN) scan → less likely to be logged by firewall
* `-p-`: Scan **all ports** (0-65535)
* Helps find hidden ports like 1337, 8080, 2222

⛳ Result: Now you know **which doors are open** on the system

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Service & Version Detection

### 🔧 Command:

```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.10
```

### 🧠 Explanation:

* `-sV`: Detects the version of the services running (like Apache 2.4.18, OpenSSH 7.2)
* Helps you search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs)

> 📌 Combine it:

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -p- 192.168.1.10
```

---

## 🔹 Step 4: OS Detection

### 🔧 Command:

```bash
nmap -O 192.168.1.10
```

### 🧠 Explanation:

* Tries to guess the **Operating System** (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.)
* Useful for choosing the right payloads and exploits

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Aggressive Scan (All-in-One)

### 🔧 Command:

```bash
nmap -A 192.168.1.10
```

### 🧠 Explanation:

* Combines:

  * OS detection
  * Version detection
  * Script scanning
  * Traceroute

⚠️ Warning: It’s loud and noisy — avoid in stealth operations

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Scan Specific Ports

If only certain ports are interesting:

```bash
nmap -p 21,22,80,443 -sV 192.168.1.10
```

Use this when doing focused enumeration.

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Run Nmap Scripts (NSE)

Nmap has built-in scripts for **vulnerability detection, brute force, malware detection**, etc.

### 🔧 Examples:

```bash
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.10
```

```bash
nmap --script http-enum 192.168.1.10
```

### 🧠 Why?

* Helps detect things like:

  * Anonymous FTP
  * Heartbleed
  * HTTP vulnerabilities

You can find all scripts:

```bash
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
```

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Save Scan Results

📂 Save to file:

```bash
nmap -sV -oN basic-scan.txt 192.168.1.10
```

📌 `-oN`: Normal output
📌 `-oX`: XML output
📌 `-oG`: Grepable output (for scripting)

---

## 🔹 Step 9: Web Recon (If Port 80/443 Found)

When HTTP/HTTPS is open, run:

```bash
whatweb http://192.168.1.10
```

```bash
nikto -h http://192.168.1.10
```

🧠 These tools help detect:

* CMS (WordPress, Joomla)
* Apache misconfig
* Sensitive files
* Known vulnerabilities

---

## 🧩 Netcat Port Scanning (Manual)

```bash
nc -v -n -z 192.168.1.10 1-1000
```

> Not as advanced as nmap, but useful in CTFs or limited shells.
